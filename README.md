---

## Learning Objectives

After this lessons, students will be able to:

* Explain how time series data are distinct and how to account for that.
* Create rolling means and plot time series data.
* Perform autocorrelation on sample time series data.
* Apply rolling windows to time series prediction
* Visualize time series data using matplotlib and plotly

## Student Requirements

Before this lesson(s), students should already be able to:

1. Manipulate data with Pandas.
2. Create basic data visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
3. Define and demonstrate techniques for correlating data points.

## Additional Resources

If you are interested in more resources, check out the following:
* In Pandas' datetime library, search for more information on .dt [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html).
* For additional review of these concepts, see some inspiration from the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.11-working-with-time-series.html).
* There are lots of additional tutorials on ARIMA models out there; here is a [good one](http://www.statsref.com/HTML/index.html?arima.html).
